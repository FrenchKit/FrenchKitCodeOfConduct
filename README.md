# FrenchKit Code Of Conduct

## Introduction

_In our opinion, defining a conference as pro-respect and tolerance in a Code of Conduct is intrinsically harmful. It legitimates the fact that it could be possible for a technology-focused event to oppose such values. Inclusivity is *not* an opinion. It is an universal and obvious principle._

## FrenchKit Code of Conduct 2017

**We shall not need Codes of Conduct.** And this is not just due to the fact that developers, our audience, should have already understood the principles of a good and inclusive behaviour but also because, in France, any kind of harassment or discrimination is actually "forbidden and punished in all situations" (https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F19448, https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F32247<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>).

However if, for the sake of ethics, we need to stand against what we do not appreciate or tolerate, here is our own code:
- Be respectful of **everyone**
- Understand that resources you will find at the events are meant for sharing, and not for your sole consumption. That includes drinks, food, seats and common spaces
- Be respectful of speakers' work. Preparing a talk demands effort, and they do not deserve puns, ringing phones, chatting, sleeping or any behaviour that may cause nuisance to their presentation. Please be supportive.
- Do not give your opinion about something you do not know
- Make constructive feedback
- Understand that staff is not there to serve you but, rather, to help you
- If you ever cannot make it to the conference, let others know or resell your ticket, so to allow others to participate
- And, ultimately, be _quelqu'un(e) de bien_
